# ENGR103_Final
Description:
My game on the Adafruit Circuit Playground will be a take on the timing game where a neopixel is lit up and there is a cycling effect where the user has to press the button when the lights meet. If the user gets the timing correct, they earn a point, a tone plays, and the cycling effect spins faster infinitely. There will be different game modes where the speed of the cycling is increasing, random, to the beats of a song, or slowing down.

Input Functionality:
Button 4 and 5 - The user presses to try and time the lights together.
Switch - When flipped, the game is stopped and the user can toggle between game modes as shown in the serial monitor with the press of either button 4 or 5. Flipping the switch back starts the game again.

Output Functionality:
Speaker - Plays when the user presses the button.
Neopixels - The essence of the timing game. 
Serial Monitor - Output score and game mode selection
